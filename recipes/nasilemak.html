<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Rice:</h4>
<p>2 cups coconut milk<br>
2 cups water<br>
2 cups long grain rice, rinsed and drained<br>
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced<br>
¼ teaspoon ground ginger<br>
1 whole bay leaf<br>
salt to taste</p>

<h4>Garnish:</h4>
<p>1 cup oil for frying<br>
1 cup raw peanuts<br>
1 (4 ounce) package white anchovies, washed<br>
4 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved<br>
1 medium cucumber, sliced</p>

<h4>Sauce:</h4>
<p>2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
1 medium onion, sliced<br>
3 medium shallots, thinly sliced<br>
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br>
2 teaspoons chile paste<br>
1 tablespoon water, or more as needed (Optional)<br>
1 (4 ounce) package white anchovies, washed<br>
¼ cup tamarind juice<br>
3 tablespoons white sugar<br>
salt to taste</p>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Make the rice: Stir coconut milk, water, rice, fresh ginger, ground ginger, bay leaf, and salt together in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf and keep rice warm until garnish and sauce are ready.</li>
    <li>While the rice is cooking, make the garnish: Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in peanuts and cook briefly, until lightly browned. Remove peanuts with a slotted spoon and place onto paper towels to soak up excess grease.</li>
    <li>Return the skillet to the stove. Stir in anchovies and cook, turning occasionally, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels. Discard oil and wipe out the skillet.</li>
    <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in the clean skillet. Stir in onion, shallots, and garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in chile paste and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; if mixture is too dry, add water as needed. Stir in anchovies and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in tamarind juice, sugar, and salt; simmer until sauce is thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Ladle warm rice into bowls. Top with warm sauce, then top with peanuts, fried anchovies, hard-boiled eggs, and cucumber.</li>
